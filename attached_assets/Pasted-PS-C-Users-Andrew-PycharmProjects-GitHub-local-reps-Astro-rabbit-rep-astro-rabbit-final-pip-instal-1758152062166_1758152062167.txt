INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of python-telegram-bot to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install httpx>=0.28.1 and python-telegram-bot==20.7 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested httpx>=0.28.1
    python-telegram-bot 20.7 depends on httpx~=0.25.2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
